This is a set-it and forget-it app for distributed workforces. This app aims to improve completion of critical repetive tasks that are important--but not urgent--and so are often forgotten, by providing a cue via an SMS reminder.

## Use Case - A Construction Company
Peter Davis Builder's has a distributed workforce of 20-30 carpenters working on 5-10 custom homes at a given time. The 2 project managers are stretched thin juggling these projects. 

For liability purposes it is important that employees hold their weekly safety meeting and document their findings. However, because of the non-urgency of this task it is often forgotten or overlooked causing project managers reminded to fill out their safety minutes and deposit them in an appropriate location.

To remove this extra burden we can automate reminders and provide cues for employees leading to more efficient operation and removing obstacles from the bottleneck--project management and support.
